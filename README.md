# NIO-S3 - Java NIO.2 implementation for AWS S3

## 🔭 Overview
This is a [JSR-203](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=203) implementation of Amazon Simple Storage Service, a.k.a. S3, allowing operations on buckets as if they were file systems. This approach decouples the business logic from the underlying infrastructure chosen for I/O operations, making it straightforward to swap out the storage provider without affecting the rest of the codebase.
